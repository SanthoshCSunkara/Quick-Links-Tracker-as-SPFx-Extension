# quick-links-tracker

## Summary

Once the app is deployed, it will log every quicklink user click activity to SP list.
üîÅ Project Summary: Quick Links Tracker (SPFx Extension)
‚úÖ What We Built:
An SPFx Application Customizer (extension) to log Quick Links clicks on SharePoint Online pages.
‚úÖ What It Logs:
Title of the clicked link (captured from Quick Links).
Link URL (actual destination URL).
ClickedTime (ISO timestamp).
User (current user's display name or email).
‚úÖ How It Works:
Listens for clicks on elements with data-automation-id="quick-links-item-title" (used by default Quick Links).
Traverses to the parent <a> element to fetch the actual link URL.
Logs all details to a custom SharePoint list: ClickAnalytics.
‚úÖ Optimized for:
Performance (minimal event listener, async logging).
Production readiness (error handling, non-blocking, efficient).
Site-wide flexibility (works across all pages with Quick Links).
üìÇ Key Files:
QuickLinksTrackerApplicationCustomizer.ts
Connected to ClickAnalytics list with fields: Title, LinkUrl, ClickedTime, User
